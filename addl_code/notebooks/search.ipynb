       "  'combinedJudgementText': 'VALMIKI J. MEHTA, J\\n1. The petitioner society by this petition under Articles 226 and 227\\nof the Constitution of India challenges the order dated 18.3.2004\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 1 of 17\\npassed by the Delhi Cooperative Tribunal (DCT) dismissing its appeal\\nagainst the Award of the Arbitrator dated 7.10.2003. By the award,\\nthe Arbitrator upheld the claim of the claimant/respondent no.1 herein and directed the petitioner society to give a plot to the respondent no.1\\non payment of cost of land.\\n2. Before us, the learned counsel for the petitioner has challenged\\nthe decisions of the authorities below on three principal grounds:-\\n(i) The respondent no.1‟s father was not a member of the society as\\nhe had resigned from his earlier membership in the year 1951 and his membership application of 1952 was never accepted by the society.\\n(ii) The claim of the membership by the respondent no.1 is barred by\\nvirtue of Rule 35(7) of the Delhi Cooperative Societies Rules, 1973\\n(hereinafter referred to as the „said Rules‟) inasmuch as no challenge\\nwas laid by the respondent no.1 within 30 days of his filing of an application for grant of membership as a nominee of his father,\\nalthough, within a period of 30 days, the society did not enrol\\nrespondent no.1 as a member.\\n(iii) There are no plots available with the petitioner society for\\nallotment, and in fact, even persons who are senior in the list to the\\nrespondent no.1, assuming the respondent no.1 to be a member, have not been allotted plots. Also, there is no space available for carving\\nout any fresh plots because New Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC),\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 2 of 17\\nbeing appropriate local authority, has said that the plot density stands\\nexhausted.\\nThe learned counsel for the petitioner has also urged that\\nthere is no equity in favour of the respondent no.1 for allotment of a plot on account of his father having paid Rs.25/- in the year 1952 and\\nno charges thereafter having been received towards cost of the land or\\ndevelopment of the land.\\n3. Learned counsel for respondent, on the other hand, has\\ncountered the arguments as raised by the counsel for the petitioner by\\nurging that it is incorrect for the petitioner society to claim that the father of the respondent no.1 was not enrolled as a fresh member\\nagain in the year 1952 inasmuch as in various lists after 2001, which\\nwere filed with the Registrar of Cooperative Society, the father of the\\nrespondent no.1 was shown to be a member. We may note that it was\\nargued that in fact the membership was since 1951. It was further\\nurged that it cannot be contended that Rule 35(7) bars the membership of the respondent no.1 inasmuch as legal cases were\\npending between the respondent no.1/his father with the petitioner\\nsociety and in these proceedings, the respondent no.1 has been\\nsubstituted as a legal heir of his father and which orders were not\\nchallenged by the petitioner society. It is lastly urged relying upon a letter of the NDMC dated 25.3.2002 that there is space available for\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 3 of 17\\nmaking a plot on account of an electricity sub-station being not\\nconstructed in the colony.\\n4. In rejoinder, the learned counsel for the petitioner has, inter alia,\\nargued that the name of the father of the respondent no.1 was shown in the list only on account of the fact that the amount of Rs.25/- was\\nshown in the suspense account in the books of the petitioner society\\nunder the rejected application of 1952 and therefore to cover up this\\nentry, the father of respondent no.1 was shown as a member. It is\\nargued further that the list on which reliance has been placed upon by the respondent no.1 itself showed that the claim of membership is of\\nthe year 1951 and admittedly, the said membership was terminated on\\naccount of the resignation of the father of the respondent no.1. It is\\ntherefore, said that the lists which are referred to itself proceeded on\\nan incorrect premise of membership of the year 1951. Reference has also been made to the various resolutions passed by the petitioner\\nsociety refusing to accept the respondent no.1 as a member and also\\nrefusing to accept the amount of Rs.15,000/- which was sought to be\\npaid by cheque by the father of the respondent no.1 in the year 1952.\\n5. We find on a reference to the decisions of both the authorities below that the same are in fact totally cryptic and almost entirely\\nbereft of reasoning. The arguments as raised by the petitioner society\\nhave been given a mere lip service and in substance, the same have\\nnot met.\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 4 of 17\\nThe first issue as raised by the petitioner society was that the\\nfather of the respondent no.1 has resigned in 1951 and the subsequent application of 1952 was not accepted. A reference to the pleadings\\nfiled by the respondent no.1‟s father in the original proceedings before\\nthe Arbitrator shows that the claim of membership is not of the year\\n1951 but of the year 1952, meaning thereby, that the resignation of\\n1951 is not an issue and a fresh claim of membership was made on account of the application having been filed in 1952 for fresh\\nmembership. This is the conclusion one can easily draw by reference\\nto para 4 of the written statement filed by the petitioner society in the\\narbitration proceedings and to which there is only a general denial by\\nthe respondent no.1.\\nWritten Statement of Society\\n“4. That the dispute being raised is hopelessly “4. That the dispute being raised is hopelessly\\nbarred by time in as much as the claimant had\\nresigned from membership of the society and his\\nresignation was accepted vide resolution of the\\nManaging Committee on 5.5.1951 (Annexure-) in the\\namount of share money was refunded to him by re-\\nallotting his share to one Sh. B.N.Talwar. The\\nclaimant again applied for membership but his claimant again applied for membership but his\\napplication was rejected by the Management\\nCommittee in its meeting on 5/11/52 and the deposit\\nof membership fee an share money was never\\naccepted but kept under suspense account. And\\nsince the question of limitation goes to the root of the\\nmatter in controversy and since its adjudication is the\\nvery basis of the claim and since the legal very basis of the claim and since the legal\\nimplications revolve around it, it can be adjudicated\\nupon at any stage of any legal proceedings.”\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 5 of 17\\nRejoinder of Member\\n“4. The contention of this para is denied. The\\nclaimant filed this claim u/s 60 before the Joint\\nRegistrar (Arbitration) Cooperative societies who has\\nrightly admitted the application u/s 60 and referred the same to this Hon‟ble court for decision u/s 61 of\\nthe Act and the respondent society has no jurisdiction\\nto raise this objection at this stage before the Hon‟ble\\ncourt. The application was within time as per\\nprovision of sub (4) of sec. 60 of the Act.”\\nIn fact, there is no doubt on this aspect whatsoever\\nbecause the authorities below have also proceeded on the basis of the membership of 1952 and the resignation of membership of 1951 being\\ncorrect. If there is any doubt whatsoever the same is cleared by a\\nreference to para 1 of the replication filed by the respondent no.1\\nherein in the arbitration proceedings and which reads as under:-\\n“1. That the contention of para 1 of written\\nstatement is denied and the corresponding para of statement is denied and the corresponding para of\\nthe same is reaffirmed as correct. The claimant\\nbecame a member on 5.11.1952 by depositing the\\nshare money and admission fee and the society did\\nnot reject this application and the claimant deemed\\nto be a member of the society from that date.”\\n(Emphasis added)\\nIt is quite clear that the claim of membership is It is quite clear that the claim of membership is\\nundoubtedly from 1952 only and that also on a deeming basis.\\n6. Curiously, the list of membership which has been relied upon by\\nthe respondent no.1 of 2001 and later years itself show that the\\nreference of membership of the father of the respondent no.1 is not on\\nthe basis of the membership of 1952 but of the year 1951. The entry in the list of the year 2003 is relevant and the same reads as under:-\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 6 of 17\\n“C. List of members (Non-plot holders)\\nS. No. Name and Father‟s Age at Date of Date of Date of Amount Whether\\nMS No. address of husband the time application resolution deposit of share affidavit\\nthe member name of for in which of share & adm. recd. at\\nenrolment enrolment member and fee the time enrolment enrolment member and fee the time\\nship Adm. of\\napproved Fee. enrolment\\n1. 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\\n- - - - - - - -- -\\n5. Sh.S.N.Sharma, Sh. 42 6.1.51 22.11.50 „‟ No. -do-\\nWZ-1840, Rani Rajinder\\nBagh, Delhi. Narain\\n7. The aforesaid therefore leaves no manner of doubt that a mistake\\nhas been committed, which is apparent, of the reference in the lists of membership, of the respondent no.1‟s father, because the reference is\\nto the membership of the year 1951 and when it is not even the case\\nof the respondent no.1 and his father that the membership is of 1951,\\nand their claim of membership is of the year 1952. We are, therefore,\\ninclined to accept the stand of the petitioner society that it was only on account of an amount of Rs.25/- lying in the suspense account, that the\\nfather of the respondent no.1 was shown as a member, of course as a\\nnon-plot holder. Clearly, therefore, there is doubt of the membership\\nof the father of the respondent no.1 simply because it is based on the\\nlists of 2001 onwards. Membership would require a resolution of the society accepting the membership, and on such query being put to the\\ncounsel for the respondent no.1, it is admitted that neither is there any\\nresolution nor was any membership certificate issued to the\\nrespondent no.1‟s father on the basis of the application of 1952. On\\nbehalf of the respondent no.1, reference of claim of membership was made on the basis of the receipt of deposit of Rs.25/-, however, the\\ncounsel for the petitioner has referred to the resolutions of 1952\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 7 of 17\\nonwards which clearly show that the application for membership of the\\nrespondent no.1‟s father of 1952 was never accepted and the society\\nalso refused to encash a cheque of Rs.15,000/- as given by the father of the respondent no.1. The relevant resolutions in this behalf read as\\nunder:-\\n(A) “Annexure-5\\nThe Secretary,\\nB-S Co-op.

Secretary”\\nIn view of the aforesaid, it is quite clear that there is no claim of\\nmembership of the respondent No.1‟s father of the year 1951 and the\\nclaim of the membership of the year 1952 is clearly without basis because undoubtedly resolutions of the petitioner society show that the\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 10 of 17\\nclaim of membership on the basis of the application of the year 1952\\nwas not accepted and in fact categorically rejected.\\n8. Before we proceed ahead, it is necessary, at this stage, to refer\\nto relevant paragraphs of the Award i.e. the decision of the first authority and the impugned order of DCT to show as to how the stand\\nof the society has not at all been fairly and correctly discussed. The\\nonly relevant portion of the Award rejecting the stand of the society\\nreads as under:\\n“I have gone through the submissions filed, the oral\\narguments advanced by both the parties and the record\\navailable on file.

Sharma was an original member.\\nHis offer of Rs.15,000/- by way of a demand draft for a\\nplot larger in size was not accepted by the society at\\nappropriate time, basically leading to the present\\ndispute. The original claimant seems to have\\nperformed his part of duty and obligations towards the\\nsociety in his attempts to get his plot. The plea of resignation of Sh. S.N. Sharma and his subsequent re-\\nentry to settle some accounts are not tenable as they\\nare neither supported by any reason nor by the law. It\\nhas to be presumed that he continued to be a member\\nof the society till the end of his life and his name\\ncontinued to be shown in the list of members. Had he\\nnot been a member, such situation would not have not been a member, such situation would not have\\narisen. On the aspect of the present petitioner being\\nthe legal heir of the original claimant, when the issue\\nwas decided by the Arbitrator in presence of the\\nrespondent society, the same was not challenged or\\ndisputed by the society. The society had also not asked\\nfor the nominees/legal representatives of Late Sh. S.N. Sharma which they were required to do within 30 days\\nfrom the date of death of the member. Also, in the\\npresent case there is no dispute between the legal heirs\\nof late Sh. S.N. Sharma and all other legal heirs have\\ngiven separate affidavit in favour of Sh. P.N. Sharma\\nrelinquishing their rights in the estate of late Sh. S.N.\\nSharma. Moreover, a Succession Certificate is also in WPC -9660/2004 Page 11 of 17\\nsupport of the petitioner. On the issue of the\\navailability of land, the petitioner made reference to the\\njudgment of the trial court dt. 31.3.1965 confirmed by\\nthe Delhi High Court on 21.7.72, which released the\\nland for giving plots to the members whose names were\\nprovided by defendant society to the court which\\nincluded the name of Late Sh. S.N. Sharma.” included the name of Late Sh. S.N. Sharma.”\\n9. The relevant portion of the order of the DCT which is in fact an\\norder of just five paragraphs, the relevant para being para No.4, reads\\nas under:\\n“4. I find that it is true that Late Sh. S.N. Sharma\\nresigned from the membership in 1951 but\\nsubsequently the Managing Committee decided to\\nadmit him as a member as a special case in order to clear the suspense item in the accounts pending for a\\nnumber of years. I also find that the name of Shri S.N.\\nSharma figures in the list provided by the society to the\\ncourt whose judgment dated 31.3.1965 was confirmed\\nby the Delhi High Court on 21.7.1972.”\\nA reference to the aforesaid findings of the authorities\\nbelow shows that there is absolutely no discussion as to why the membership on the basis of the year 1952 of the respondent No.1‟s\\nfather has been accepted when admittedly the resolutions show that\\nthe application was rejected. A reference in the list of year 2001\\nshowing the membership of respondent No.1‟s father cannot stand in\\nthe face of the categorical resolution of the petitioner society rejecting the membership of the respondent No.1‟s father. We have already\\nmade reference to the fact that list of the year 2003 itself refers to the\\nmembership of the respondent No.1‟s father with reference to the year\\n1951 and not of 1952, and not the former but the latter is the claim of\\nthe membership of the respondent No.1‟s father i.e. of 1952 only and\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 12 of 17 WPC -9660/2004 Page 12 of 17\\nnot of 1951. In fact, the Arbitrator used the expression “it has to be\\npresumed that he continued to be a member of the society till the end\\nof his life.......” Clearly, the Arbitrator was wholly unjustified in acting\\non the basis of a presumption in view of the categorical resolutions\\nfiled and relied upon by the petitioner society. There is absolutely no discussion of any substance on this aspect in the award and we feel\\nthat this would be because there was no answer which could be given\\nby the Arbitrator once the resolutions rejecting the membership\\napplication of the year 1952 of the respondent No.1‟s father clearly\\nestablished on record the falsity of the claim of membership. The other discussion in the Award with regard to the present respondent No.1/the\\nson stepping into the shoes of his father would be not of any issue\\ninasmuch as our present judgment proceeds on the basis that the\\nrespondent No.1 stepped into the shoes of his father and Rule 35(7)\\ndoes not stand in his way.\\n10. The next issue to be decided is with respect to whether the petitioner society has any plot available for allotment to the\\nrespondent No.1 and whether the respondent No.1 is entitled to a plot\\nonce there are persons senior to him in the list and who have not been\\nallotted a plot. To appreciate this aspect, it is necessary to refer to the\\nlist which is relied upon by the respondent No.1 to show the membership of the father of the respondent No.1 in which the father of\\nthe respondent No.1 is shown at serial No.5 in the list of non-plot\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 13 of 17\\nholders. The list of the non-plot holders and in which the respondent\\nNo.1‟s father is only at serial No.5 reads as under:\\n“BURMAH SHELL CO-OPERATIVE HOUSING SOCIETY LTD.\\n(REGD.)\\nList of Non-Plot-holder members as on 31.03.2001 List of Non-Plot-holder members as on 31.03.2001\\nS.No. Membership Name in full Share money paid\\nNo.\\n......... ............. ........... ............\\n106 50 Sh.

Sharma Rs.25/-\\n___________\\nTotal Rs.2,750/-“ ___________\\nTotal Rs.2,750/-“\\n11. The counsel for the respondent No.1 has drawn our attention to a\\ndecision of the learned Single Judge of this Court in Writ Petition (C)\\nNo.356/03 titled as Rakesh Kumar Vs. The Burmah Shell Co-\\noperative Housing Society Ltd. and Ors. dated 7.10.2004. This\\ndecision pertains to a writ petition filed by Sh. Rakesh Kumar who is at serial No.106 and the first in the list of non-plot holders. By the order\\ndated 7.10.2004, the writ petition and the claim of the said Rakesh\\nKumar was rejected and only his request for a flat was acceded to. We\\nmay also note, at this stage, that a flat was offered to the respondent\\nNo.1 and his father but the said offer of the petitioner society was\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 14 of 17 WPC -9660/2004 Page 14 of 17\\nrejected by them. In the order dated 7.10.2004 in W.P.(C) No.356/03,\\nthe stand of the NDMC has been noted that there is no land for carving\\nout further plots in the society. The relevant paras of the judgment\\ndated 7.10.2004 are paras 15,19, 24 and 26 which read as under:\\n“15. Stand of NDMC in the counter affidavit is that on 6.12.2001, it was informed to the society that additional\\nplots could not be permitted in existing parks, green\\nplaces or on roads. Society was asked to submit a\\nrevised plan excluding parks, green spaces or roads from\\nbeing brought within plotted area. Society submitted\\nrevised plans on 21.12.2001. Proposal was based on\\nnorms of 23.7.1998 stayed by the Supreme Court. norms of 23.7.1998 stayed by the Supreme Court.\\nMoreover, additional plot proposed to be carved out\\nbeing on existing park, plan could not be sanctioned.\\nxxxxxxxx\\n19. NDMC categorically states that Master Plan norms\\nunder which plotted area has to be determined, on being\\napplied, has exhausted plotted development. Petitioner\\nhas brought no material on record to show that an has brought no material on record to show that an\\nadditional plot can be carved out.\\nXxxxxxx\\n24. Execution filed by late Sh. R.C. Trivedi is pending\\nbefore the Additional Collector (REC). Order dated\\n5.10.1999 passed by the Additional Collector,\\nunfortunately cannot be given effect to as the two plots\\nattached by the Additional Collector, being on park, cannot be converted into plots. Further, categorical\\nstand of NDMC is that Master Plan norms have been\\nexhausted vis-a-vis plotted development.\\nXxxxxxx\\n26. Writ petition is accordingly disposed of with a\\ndirection to the Additional Collector (REC) before whom\\nexecution proceedings are pending to determine as to\\nwhat additional construction can be permitted on the multi-storeyed block. The award, as noted above, directs\\na flat or a plot to be allotted to the claimant. The\\nexecuting authority who has to execute the award would\\nproceed to issue notice to the NDMC as well as the\\nsociety on the issue of determining whether an\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 15 of 17\\nadditional flat could be constructed as per revised FAR norms. It would be free to the Additional Collector to\\nissue such appropriate directions as it feels would be\\nnecessary to give effect to execution of the award dated\\n12.1.1990.” (Emphasis added)\\nClearly, assuming that respondent No.1‟s father was a\\nmember and the respondent No.1 stepped into the shoes of his father\\nas a nominee member, yet, once the local authority has taken up a clear cut stand that no plot is available, and the plot and population\\ndensity stands satisfied, it is not permissible to violate the law by\\ncarving out a plot from open ground areas and parks in the petitioner\\nsociety for being allotted to the respondent No.1. The decision in the\\nW.P.(C) 356/2003 is dated 7.10.2004 and the letter of NDMC relied upon by the respondent no.1 is earlier of 25.3.2002. Of course, we\\nhave already held that the respondent No.1‟s father never became a\\nmember on the basis of his application of the year 1952 and admittedly\\nhis membership of the year 1951 came to an end by means of his own\\nresignation.\\n12. We also feel that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, as also in equity, a person who has just contributed Rs.25/- in the\\nyear 1952, and further assuming that a sum of Rs.15,000/- was also\\npaid (though the said cheque of respondent No.1‟s father was never\\nencashed by the petitioner society), we do not feel that the respondent\\nNo.1 should be entitled to a plot of land, especially keeping in view the fact that there are four other senior members who have not been\\nallotted a plot. The claim of the respondent No.1 is at best to stand in\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 16 of 17\\nthe line and his entitlement would only arise if the members senior to\\nhim, who are otherwise eligible, have been allotted plots and which is\\nnot so. Looking at it from other angle, we do not feel that the respondent No.1 was entitled to plot.\\n13. In view of the above, we accept the writ petition and set aside\\nthe orders of both the authorities below inasmuch as they are not only\\ncryptic but they fail to discuss the relevant facts and the issues, and\\nwhich if would have been done the same would have resulted in a\\ndecision in favour of the petitioner society. We, therefore, set aside the impugned order dated 18.3.2004 passed by the DCT and Award dated\\n7.10.2003 and dismiss the claim petition as filed by respondent No.1\\nand his father for grant of a plot in the petitioner society. The parties\\nare left to bear their own costs.\\nVALMIKI J. MEHTA, J.\\nOCTOBER 06, 2010 SANJAY KISHAN KAUL, J.\\nib/Ne\\nWPC -9660/2004 Page 17 of 17'},\n",

       "  'combinedJudgementText': '1. The petitioner, who appears in person, has challenged the order dated\\n27.01.2012 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench,\\nNew Delhi in OA 273/2012, whereby the petitioner’s said Original Application\\nwas dismissed. The relief sought by the petitioner before the Tribunal was for\\nquashing of the allegedly frivolous, false and fabricated charge-sheet vide order No. 8/23/2010- Vig. II dated 19th August, 2010 at the earliest. The facts, as\\nindicated before the Tribunal are set out in paragraph 2 of the impugned order\\nand it would be suffice if we would reproduce the same.\\nWP(C)No.798/2012 Page1of5\\n“2. Briefly stated, facts of the case are that the applicant while\\nworking as Assistant Director in Telecom Engineering Centre, Department of Telecom, New Delhi, was issued a charge memo\\ndated 19.08.2010, whereby it was proposed to hold an enquiry\\nagainst him under Rule 14 of the CCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. It\\nmay be stated that before issuing the aforesaid memo the\\napplicant was placed under suspension. The gravamen of the\\ncharge against the applicant, as can be seen from the statement of article of charge annexed with the memo as Annexure-I and\\nstatement of imputation of misconduct/misbehaviour in support of\\narticles of charge, Annexure-II, are that the applicant refused to\\nabide by the instructions issued by his seniors, whereby he was\\ndirected to carry out the work of C&T Division and to put up the\\ntraining proposals received from different officers of TEC, thus, he has failed to maintain absolute devotion to his duties and acted\\nin a manner, which is unbecoming of Government servant,\\nthereby contravening the provisions of Rule 3-A (a) and (b) of\\nCCS (Conduct) Rules, 1964 and Rule 3 (1) (i), (ii) and (iii) of\\nCCS (CCA) Rules, 1965. The second charge against the\\napplicant was that applicant made frivolous and baseless complaint against the senior officers of the Department and used\\ninsulting and defamatory language against the superior officers\\nand thus committed grave misconduct, which tantamount to\\ninsulting and insubordination to such a degree as to be\\nincompatible with the relation of superior officers and subordinate\\nofficers. The charges against the applicant are required to be proved on the basis of 30 documents mentioned in the list of\\ndocuments annexed with the memo (Annexure-III) and thus the\\ncharges were required to be proved on the basis of the list of\\nwitnesses annexed with the memo (Annexure IV). The challenge\\nhas been made to the aforesaid charge-sheet on the ground that\\nthe Director (C&T) and Director (Admn.) hatched a criminal conspiracy to cause him financial loss and mental harassment and\\nthe applicant was not provided with the sitting space, office\\naccommodation, requisite resources, staff etc. and domain of\\nwork, duties and responsibilities were not provided to him despite\\nbeing present in the office premises, despite the fact that he has\\nmade several requests for sitting space, requisite resources duties and working responsibilities. Whereas from the material placed\\non record, more particularly page-63 of the paper-book, it is\\nWP(C)No.798/2012 Page2of5\\nevident that DDG (CT) has directed the applicant to sit in the\\noffice of PS to DDG (CT) and use resources/staff etc. present\\nthere and of Director (CT) till adequate resources/staff etc. are arranged for him, but despite that applicant refused to obey the\\ninstructions of senior officers, i.e., DDG (CT) and Director (CT)\\nand did not perform the task assigned to him. A perusal of this\\ndocument further reveals that since PS was not posted with DDG\\n(CT), as such, as an interim measure applicant was directed bythe\\nDDG (CT) to sit in the said room and use the resources/staff etc. there, which are sufficient for him to carry out the tasks assigned\\nto him. Perusal of this document further reveals that there is only\\none DDG, one Director and only one Assistant Director in CT\\nDivision. Whatever responsibilities are assigned to DDG (CT),\\nDirector has to assist him so that work is done efficiently.\\nLikewise, the Assistant Director is required to assist Director and has to act as a supporting officer, but despite that applicant\\nrefused the official work, which is specifically assigned to him in\\nwriting by the DDG (CT) and the period during which applicant\\ndid not perform the duty was also treated as dies non. Be that as\\nit may, as already stated above, the allegations against the\\napplicant in the charge-sheet are regarding disobedience of the order passed by the superior authorities and also using insulting\\nand defamatory language against his superior officers, it is not\\npermissible for us at this stage to go into the truth and correctness\\nof the charges leveled against the applicant. Whether the charges\\nare sustainable or not, is a matter to be gone into during enquiry\\nproceedings and it is not a case of such nature where the charges framed against applicant are vague and are not elucidated by the\\nstatement of particulars or in any other manner or the disciplinary\\nproceedings have been initiated by an authority incompetent to\\ninitiate such proceedings etc. Thus, it is not permissible for us to\\nquash the charge-memo at this stage solely on the ground that the\\ncharges leveled against the applicant are result of a criminal conspiracy hatched by the Director (C&T) and Director (Admn.)\\nof Telecom Engineering Centre.”\\n2. The Tribunal placed reliance on the decision of the Supreme Court in the\\ncase of Transport Commissioner, Madras-5 v. A. Radha Krishna Moorthy:\\nWP(C)No.798/2012 Page3of5\\n(1995) 1 SCC 332 in order to support its conclusion that the truth and correctness of charges cannot be gone into by the Tribunal and more\\nparticularly at a stage prior to the conclusion of the disciplinaryenquiry.\\n3. From the narration of facts referred to above, it is apparent that certain\\ncharges have been leveled against the petitioner and the petitioner also has very\\nstrong grievances with regard to the said charges. He is at full liberty to take whatever plea of defence he can before the Enquiry Officer and in that, there\\nshall be no hindrance insofar as the enquiry proceedings are concerned. Insofar\\nas the interference of the Tribunal is concerned, we entirely agree with the\\nconclusion of the Tribunal that it cannot interfere with the proceedings at this\\nstage, particularly when there are allegations on the part of the petitioner with regard to the truth and correctness of charges and which would undeniably\\nrequire the enquiry proceedings to take place. The petitioner would have full\\nopportunity before the Enquiry Officer to establish that the charges are false and\\n/ or mala fide, as alleged by him. He would have an opportunity to go through\\nall the material which is sought to be relied upon against him and also to cross- examine the witnesses who are sought to be produced against him. He can also\\nproduce his own witnesses in defence.\\nWP(C)No.798/2012 Page4of5\\n4. In these circumstances, we find no infirmity in the Tribunal’s order. The\\nwrit petition is dismissed. There shall be no order as to costs.\\nBADAR DURREZ AHMED, J\\nV.K. JAIN, J\\nFEBRUARY 10, 2012\\nSR\\nWP(C)No.798/2012 Page5of5'},\n",

The defence of the defendants is that there was a oral partition in\\nthe year 1987 in respect of some of “A” schedule properties and they\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go3v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nhave been in separate and exclusive possession and enjoyment of the\\nproperties allotted to them in the oral partition, that pattas were issued\\nseparately, that “B” schedule house property was allotted to the share of\\nthe first defendant in the said oral partiton and since then, the first\\ndefendant along with his family has been in possession and enjoyment of the same, that the plaintiff and the first defendant have partitioned the\\nother properties and enjoying separately by paying taxes and that\\ntherefore, the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the suit and as such,\\nthe suit is liable to be set aside.\\n6.

The learned Counsel for the appellants would submit that items 5 to 10 in “A” schedule and the house property in “B” schedule have\\nalready been divided between the parties as early as in 1987, that the trial\\nCourt has failed to consider that there was a division in status in the year\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go5v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n1987 itself with regard to the above properties and that therefore, the above items 5 to 10 in “A” schedule and house property in “B” schedule\\nare no more common properties and as such, the plaintiff is not entitled\\nfor the relief of partition in respect of those properties.\\n10. The learned Counsel for the respondents would submit that the\\ntrial Court, considering the pleadings and evidence available on record, has come to a decision that there was no oral partition effected between\\nthe plaintiff and the first defendant, that “B” schedule house property was\\nadmittedly purchased by the plaintiff and the first defendant vide sale ded\\ndated 22.09.1964 and that since the defendants have miserably failed to\\nprove the alleged oral partition, the trial Court has rightly granted\\npreliminary decree. preliminary decree.\\n11. The points for consideration are\\n(1) Whether the learned trial Judge erred in deciding that the\\ndefendants have failed to prove the alleged oral partition, despite\\nshowing that items 5 to 10 in “A” schedule properties were partitioned\\nbetween the plaintiff and the first defendant and since then, they have\\nbeen in separate possession and enjoyment of the same by receiving https://www.mhc.tn.go6v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nseparate patta and paying taxes therefor and that “B” schedule house\\nproperty was allotted to the first defendant in the said partition and since\\nthen, they have been in separate possession and enjoyment of the same\\nby paying taxes therefor?\\n(2) Whether the trial Court erred in granting preliminary decree in respect of the entire properties despite proving that there was an oral\\npartition in the year 1987 and the same was followed by separate\\npossession and enjoyment of the same?\\n(3) Whether the impugned judgment and decree dated 17.03.2010,\\npassed in O.S.No.74 of 2008 is liable to be interfered with?\\n(4) To what other reliefs, the parties are entitled?\\nC.M.P.(MD)No.1633 of 2023: C.M.P.(MD)No.1633 of 2023:\\n12. The above petition is for reception of additional evidence filed\\nunder Order 41 Rule 27 C.P.C.\\n13. The appellants are the petitioners. The second appellant has\\nfiled an affidavit in support of the above petition stating that they\\ncontended that there was an oral partition and in order to prove the oral\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go7v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\npartiton, the documents sought to be received are absolutely necessary,\\nthat though the documents come into existence during the pendency of\\nthe appeal proceedings, the recitals therein would prove the oral partition\\nbetween the parties and also the enjoyment as per the oral partition,\\nwhich is the main issue involved in the above case and that the respondents are not having any valid objection for receiving the same.\\n14. The petitioners/appellants have produced the certified copy of\\nthe settlement deed executed by the respondents 2, 3 and 5 in favour of\\nthe fourth respondent and the information given by the Revenue\\nDivisional Officer, Dindigul, in response to RTI application and the pattas standing in the name of the fourth respondent. Admittedly, the\\nrespondents have not filed any counter statement or objections to the\\nabove petition. It is not in dispute that the settlement deed came to be\\nexecuted on 19.08.2016 during the pendency of the appeal. The\\nrespondents have specifically admitted the execution of settlement deed and according to them, the same will not help the appellants to prove the\\nalleged oral partition. Moreover, the respondents have disputed neither\\nthe genuineness nor the contents of the document Nos.2 and 3 and that\\nthe reply received from the Revenue Divisional Officer and the pattas.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go8v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n15. As already pointed out, according to the appellants/defendants,\\nthe above documents are necessary to prove their main defence of oral\\npartition that was occurred between the plaintiff and the first defendant.\\nMore importantly, the above documents came into existence subsequent\\nto filing of the appeal. Considering the above and since there was no specific or serious objections from the respondents, this Court is inclined\\nto receive the additional evidence. Accordingly, the documents produced\\nalong with the above petitions are ordered to be received and are\\nexhibited as Exs.B.11 to B.13.\\n16. In the written statement, the defendants have taken a specific\\nstand that there was a partition in the year 1987 wherein S.No.2051/2 and 2052/4 were partitioned and S.Nos.2051/2C1 and 2052/4B were allotted\\nto the share of the first defendant with separate patta No.2996 and the\\nlands in S.No.2051/2C2 and 2052/4B were allotted to the share of the\\nplaintiffs with separate patta No.492, that the first defendant had dug a\\nwell in S.No.2051/2C1 in the year 1981 and obtained service connection and two bore wells and that the plaintiff and the first defendant have been\\nin separate possession and enjoyment of the said properties allotted to\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go9v/.i2n/0judis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nthem in the partition. It is their further defence that “B” schedule\\nproperty was alloted to the first defendant in the partition and that the other properties were also partitioned for convenience sake and are in the\\nseparate possession and enjoyment of the same.\\n17. Admittedly, the defendants in their written statement have\\nnowhere whispered that the partition alleged to have been effected in the\\nyear 1987 is a oral partition and the persons in whose presence, the same was effected. But in the chief examination affidavit, D.W.1 has stated\\nthat in the year 1984, in the presence of common people, the properties in\\nS.No.2051/2 and 2052 were partitioned and sub-divided lands were\\nallotted to them and that separate pattas came to be issued to them.\\n18. As already pointed out, in the written statement, they have alleged that the partition was effected in the year 1987, but in the chief\\nexamination affidavit, D.W.1 would state that the partition was effected\\nin the year 1984. When the above contradiction was brought to his\\nnotice during his cross-examination, he would admit the same and the\\nsame is extracted hereunder:\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v0.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n“gp.brl;oa[y; brhj;Jf;fis 1987-y; gphptpid bra;J\\nbfhz;Blhk; vd;W vjph;tHf;Fiuapy; brhy;ypa[s;Bsd; vd;why;\\nrhpay;y. 1985-y; gphpj;Jf;bfhz;Blhk;. vjph;tHf;Fiuapy;\\n1987k; Bjjp gphptpid bra;J bfhz;ljhf cs;sJ vd;why;\\nrhpjhd;.”\\n19. D.W.1 would further admit that his father and the plaintiff have\\nentered into a partition in respect of S.No.2051/2 and 2052/4 and that both of them have been enjoying the properties separately, that the said\\nproperties were subsequently sub-divided and that the other properties\\nwere being enjoyed as per their convenience. D.W.1 would admit that\\nthe land in S.No.2054 was not partitioned and he does not know the\\nreason for the same and the same is extracted hereunder:\\n“rh;Bt vz;.2052/4 epyj;ij xl;o Bky;g[wk; rh;Bt vz;.2054 epyk; cs;sJ vd;why; rhpjhd;. rh;Bt vz;.2054y; cs;s\\nepyj;ij gphptpid bra;ahjjw;F fhuzk; vd;d vd;w tptuk;\\nvdf;F bjhpahJ. gp.th.rh.M.1y; gl;lhtpy; fz;l epyj;ij tpl\\ngp.th.rh.M.3y; fz;l gl;lhtpd; epyj;jpd; tp!;jPuzk; Fiwthf\\ncs;sJ vd;why; rhpjhd;.”\\nD.W.1 would further say\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v1.in/2/ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n“rh;Bt vz;.2055/1y; Bky;g[uk; 71 brz;il mDgtpf;fpBwhk;.

As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the respondents, D.W.1 would specifically admit that there is no equality in\\nthe share as per Exs.B.1 and B.3 patta and that he was not aware about\\nthe extent and in which portion they were enjoying.\\n21. The defendants have examined D.W.2 to prove the alleged\\npartition between the plaintiff and the first defendant. D.W.2 in his chief examination affidavit would say that the plaintiff and the defendants\\nwere enjoying the properties allotted to them jointly in the partition\\neffected in 1962 and that both of them have partitioned two Survey\\nNumber lands in the presence of common people 25 years back. But in\\nthe cross-examination, he would specifically admit that himself and his brother have filed a civil suit in O.S.No.543 of 2001 against the plaintiff,\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v2.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nthat since the suit was decided against them, they have preferred an\\nappeal in A.S.No.63 of 2004 and the same was decided against them and\\nthat subsequently they have sold that property to one Ramalakshmi under Ex.B.4, that he was not aware of the extent of lands in the concerned\\nsurvey numbers and that he has filed the chief examination affidavit as\\ndirected by the first defendant.\\n22. Considering the above, the evidence of D.W.2 is of no use to\\nthe defendants and as such, the trial Court has rightly decided that his\\nevidence is not sufficient to prove the alleged partition. 23. No doubt, as rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the\\nappellants, the plaintiff in his cross-examination would say that himself\\nand his brother – first defendant have been residing separately since\\n1994. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the respondents,\\nthe plaintiff has nowhere admitted that there was a partition with respect to some of the properties. But no doubt, he would admit the separate\\nenjoyment of some of the properties and of getting of separate pattas and\\npayment of taxes therefor.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v3.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n24. The learned Counsel for the appellants would submit that\\nduring the pendency of the appeal, the respondents have entered into a settlement on 19.08.2016 under Ex.B.11 in respect of the private\\nproperties of the first defendant and also the suit properties wherein the\\nrespondents 2, 3 and 5 have settled all the properties in favour of their\\nbrother - 4th respondent. He would further submit that the respondents 2\\nto 5 have admitted the partition allegedly effected between the plaintiff and the defendants in the settlement deed and that Ex.B.12 information\\nreceived from the Revenue Divisional Officer in response to the R.T.I.,\\napplication and Ex.B.13 patta would go to show that the parties have\\nbeen in possession and enjoyment of the properties in pursuance of the\\npartition and that therefore, the partition is to be upheld. 25. The learned Counsel for the respondents would submit that in\\nEx.B.11 settlement, the respondents 2, 3 and 5 have not executed\\nsettlement in respect of any specific property to the fourth respondent,\\nbut in the undivided ½ share of the deceased plaintiff, they have settled\\ntheir ¾ share in favour of the fourth respondent. It is necessary to refer the recitals found in Ex.B.11 settlement deed hereunder for better\\nappreciation:\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v4.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n“..........................\\n1962-k; tUlj;jpa 3751 ek;guhf gjpt[ bra;ag;gl;l\\nghfg;gphptpid gj;jpuj;jpy; fz;lgo B – b&oa{y; brhj;jhf\\nfpU&;zrhkp bul;oahUf;Fk; Bkw;goahh; mz;zd; uhkrhkp\\nbul;oahUf;Fk; fpilj;Jk; mjpy; fpU&;zrhkp bul;oahUf;F chpa $hapz;L ghjp ghj;jpaj;ija[k; mth; mDgtpj;J te;Jk;\\nBkw;go fpU&;zrhkp bul;oahh; mth;fs; brd;w 26.1.2016 -k;\\nBjjpapy; fhykhdjd; Bky; jA;fSf;Fk; vA;fSf;Fk; thhpRfpukg;\\ngo fpilj;Jk; ehk; bghJtpy; itj;J mDgtpj;J tUk;\\nnjdoapy; brhj;J tptuj;jpy; fz;l brhj;Jf;fspy; jA;fSf;Fs;s\\nbghJ 4-y; 1 gA;F Bghf vA;fSf;Fz;lhd bghJ 4-y; 3-\\ngA;F ghj;jpaj;ij kl;Lk; ...... “ gA;F ghj;jpaj;ij kl;Lk; ...... “\\n26. As rightly contended by the learned Counsel for the\\nrespondents, in their father\\'s undivided ½ share, they have settled their\\n3/4th share in favour of the fourth respondent and as such, the present\\ncontention of the appellants is liable for rejection.\\n27. In Ex.B.12 reply given by the Public Information Officer, the report of the Village Administrative Officer and the statement given by\\nthe plaintiff and the first defendant were enclosed. In the report of the\\nVillage Administrative Officer, he has observed that\\n“ ........... buA;frhkp bul;oahh; kfd; uhkrhkp-1, buA;frhkp\\nbul;oahh; kfd; fpU&;zrhkp MfpaBahh; mDgtpj;J tUk; bghJ\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v5.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nepyA;fspy; mtuth; mDgtj;jpw;F mUfpy; nUtUk; bry;y 12\\nmo ghij Bghl;Lf;bfhs;tjhft[k; .......... “\\n28. At this juncture, it is necessary to refer the judgment of this\\nCourt in Guruvammal and another Vs. Subbiah Naicker and 5 others\\nreported in 2000-1-L.W.488, wherein it has been held that mere\\nconvenience in enjoyment will not be sufficient and the relevant portion is extracted hereunder:\\n“26. Thus the position on this aspect is well settled, it has not\\nbeen shown by the appellants that dehors Exs. A-64 and A- 65\\nthere is any material available to substantiate their case of\\npartition between Krishnaswamy Naicker and Subbiah\\nNaicker.\\n27. Conceding that there was a separate enjoyment by the\\nbrothers, that will not by itself show that there was any completed partition between the brothers. The legal aspect is\\nwell settled. In Appavu @ Lakshmanan Pillai and another vs.\\nManikkam Pillai and four others ILR 1946 Mad 557 it has\\nbeen held as follows:\\n\"The fact that the members of a Hindu joint family divide\\namong themselves some of the family assets, such as income\\nfrom agricultural lands, outstandings and other movable property, does not in itself mean a division in status. In\\ndeciding whether a joint family has become divided the Court\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v6.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nmust have regard to the terms of any instrument bearing on\\nthe question and the subsequent conduct of the parties.\\nStatements made by members of the family on certain occasions for certain purposes that they are joint or divided\\nin status are not of much consequence. It is not their\\nstatements but their relations with the estate that must be\\ntaken into consideration in determining the issue.\"\\n28. In P. Kaliappa Gounder and others v. Muthuswami\\nMudaliar, it has been held by a Bench of this Court that,\\nseparate possession for the sake of convenience is no partition. The fact of separate enjoyment of specified portions\\nfor making improvements over such portions and of obtaining\\nloans will not turn joint ownership into ownership is severally\\nand in specie in the eye of law.”\\n29. In the case on hand also, it is the specific case of the\\ndefendants that they were in separate possession and enjoyment, that pattas were separately issued and that they were paying the kist and other\\ntaxes separately. In the absence of any evidence to prove that there was a\\npartition in the year 1984 or in 1987, the separate possession and\\nenjoyment can only be considered for convenience sake and as such, the\\nsame cannot be termed as partition.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v7.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010 A.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\n30. At the time of hearing, the learned Counsel for the appellants\\nwould submit that items 1, 3, 4, 5, 10 and 11 have to be divided among\\nthe appellants and the third respondnet in equal shares and as such\\npreliminary decree for partition has to be passed in respect of these items\\nalone. But as already pointed out, the defendants have not proved that there was a partition by metes and bounds in respect of other properties.\\n31. On considering the entire evidence available on record, the\\nfinding of the trial Judge that the defendants have miserably failed to\\nprove the partition alleged by them and that therefore, the plaintiff is\\nentitled to get ½ share in the entire suit properties, cannot be found fault with and this Court is in entire agreement with the same. Consequently,\\nthis Court concludes that the appeal suit is devoid of merits and the same\\nis liable to be dismissed. Considering the other facts and circumstances\\nand also the relationship between the parties, this Court further decides\\nthat the parties are to be directed to bear their own costs. 32. In the result, the Appeal Suit is dismissed, confirming the\\njudgment and decree, dated 17.03.2010 made in O.S.No.74 of 2008, on\\nthe file of the Additional District Judge, Fast Track Court, Dindigul.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.go1v8.in//2ju0dis\\nA.S.(MD)No.177 of 2010\\nC.M.P.(MD)No.1633 of 2023 is allowed and the other connected\\nMiscellaneous Petitions are dismissed.
