The appellants herein are the claimants in M.C.O.P.No.80 of 2013, on the file of the Special District Judge, to deal with the MCOP Cases,\\nVillupuram. They have filed the above said claim petition, claiming a sum of\\nRs.45,00,000/- as compensation for the death of one Bakthinarayanan, who\\ndied in the road accident that took place on 23.07.2009.\\n3. The facts which related to the filing of the present appeal are that on 23.07.2009 at about 8.40 hours, while the deceased was waiting to cross the\\nservice road in his motorcycle bearing registration No. PY01 AR 4033 on the\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n2/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\nGST Road, near Asanoor Bus stop to go to his school, a Tata Indica car\\nbearing registration No.TN59 AH 7443 came at a very high speed, driven by its driver, in a rash and negligent manner and hit against the deceased behind\\nhis motorcycle. As a result of which, the deceased sustained grievous injuries\\nand immediately, he was taken to the Government Hospital, Ulundurpet,\\nwhere, after first aid, he was referred to MIOT Hospital, Chennai. The\\ndeceased had undergone treatment from 23.07.2009 till 14.08.2009, on which date, he died due to the injuries sustained in the accident. Therefore, the claim\\npetition was filed seeking compensation of Rs.45,00,000/- against the owner\\nof the car and it's insurer.\\n4. Resisting the claim petition, the 2nd respondent / Insurance Company\\nfiled a Counter Affidavit inter alia stating that the driver of the car was not solely responsible for causing the accident and that the deceased has also\\ncontributed for the accident. According to the 2nd respondent, the deceased,\\nwithout following the Road Rules, crossed the National Highways Road in a\\nhurry. The 2nd respondent also disputed the age, income and occupation of the\\ndeceased and stated that the compensation claimed by the claimants is\\nexcessive. excessive.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n3/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\n5. Before the Tribunal, on behalf of the claimants, wife of the deceased\\nwas examined as P.W.1 apart from examining two others as P.W.2 & P.W.3\\nand marked Exs.P1 to P14. On behalf of the respondents no one was examined\\nand no document marked.\\n6. The Tribunal considering the pleadings, oral and documentary evidence, held that the accident occurred due to the negligence on the part of\\nthe driver of the car as well as the deceased and fixed the ratio of negligence at\\n80% : 20% respectively. Considering the age and the earning capacity of the\\ndeceased at Rs.15,309/-, the Special District Judge, Villupuram adopted split\\nmultiplier method and directed the 2nd respondent / Insurance Company to pay a sum of Rs.21,66,265/- [Rupees Twenty One Lakhs Sixty Six Thousand Two\\nHundred Sixty Five only] as compensation to the appellants.\\n7. As against the award passed by the Tribunal, the Insurance Company\\nhas not filed any appeal. However, the claimants have filed this Civil\\nMiscellaneous Appeal seeking enhancement of compensation.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n4/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018 4/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\n8. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants/claimant would\\ncontend that the Tribunal was not justified in deducting 20% of the amount\\ntowards contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. The Tribunal has\\nnot appreciated the evidence in proper perspective since, which resulted in miscarriage of justice. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, the\\naccident occurred solely due to rash and negligent driving of the driver of the\\ncar. Before the Tribunal, on behalf of the respondents, neither any witness was\\nexamined nor any document was marked. While so, the Tribunal ought not to\\nhave fixed the contributory negligence at 20% on the deceased. The learned counsel further pointed out that the deceased was standing on the left side of\\nthe road and was carefully crossing the road but due to the rash and negligent\\ndriving of the driver of the car, the accident had occurred. Had the driver of\\nthe car driven the vehicle in a normal speed, the accident could have been\\naverted. The learned counsel would further contend that the Tribunal has failed to grant compensation under the head of pain and sufferings since the\\ndeceased had suffered enormous pain and sufferings and after few days of\\nhospitalization, he died. The learned counsel for the appellants would also\\ncontend that the compensation awarded to the legal heirs of the deceased\\ncannot be construed as income for the purpose of calculating and deducting https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n5/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\nincome tax and therefore, deduction of income tax is legally not sustainable.\\nWith these contentions, the learned counsel for the appellants sought for\\nenhancement of compensation.\\n9. Per Contra, the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd\\nrespondent/Insurance Company contended that the Tribunal on proper evaluation of the evidence, both oral and documentary, the Tribunal has\\nrightly awarded compensation by fixing contributory negligence on the part of\\nboth the driver of the car and the deceased and awarded a reasonable\\ncompensation which is liable to be confirmed. Further, the amounts awarded\\nby the Tribunal under different heads are not meager. The appellants have not made out any case for enhancement of compensation and therefore, the learned\\ncounsel for the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company prayed for dismissal of the\\nappeal.\\n10. Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellants as well as the\\nlearned counsel appearing for the respondents and perused the entire materials\\navailable on record.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n6/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018 6/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\n11. Admittedly, there was no witness examined on the side of the\\nrespondents before the Tribunal. The respondents have also did not mark any\\ndocument in support of their defence. At the same time, merely because the\\nrespondents did not examine any witness or mark documentary evidence, the\\nTribunal is not precluded from independently considering the evidence made available before it. In this case, Tribunal had taken note of the evidence of\\nP.W.2, an eye witness as well as the copy of the rough sketch marked, Ex.P4.\\nBased on the deposition of P.W.2 and Ex.P4, the Tribunal rendered a finding\\nthat there is no crossing point, at the place of accident, to cross the road and to\\nreach the other side of the road. The Tribunal found that there is no signal at the point where the deceased crossed the road. The Tribunal also considered\\nEx.P11, Motor Vehicle Report and concluded that there was no severe\\ndamages caused to the two wheeler driven by the deceased, but there was\\ndamages on the right side of the two wheeler which would suggest that the\\ndeceased did not wait for the car to pass on, but darted across the road even when the car was fast approaching. Thus, it is evident that the place where the\\ndeceased attempted to cross the road is not a crossing-point for two wheelers\\nto cross and in spite of the same, the deceased attempted to cross the road to\\nreach the School which is on the opposite side of the road. In such\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n7/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018 7/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\ncircumstances, this Court is of the firm view that the Tribunal is wholly\\njustified in fixing 20% negligence on the part of the deceased and\\nconsequently, the findings rendered by the Tribunal in that regard are\\nconfirmed.\\n12. As regards quantum, admittedly, the deceased was working as a\\nTeacher and was in receipt of Rs.70,000/- per month. After his death, the 1st appellant/wife is in receipt of Rs.15,000/- per month as pension. The deceased\\nwas aged about 51 years at the time of accident and he had a left over service\\nof 7 years. Taking note of the above, the Tribunal adopted split multiplier.\\nThe Tribunal has taken Rs.30,328/- as the monthly salary of the deceased, after\\nall the statutory deductions, including personal expenses of the deceased himself, for the remaining 7 years of left over service, to arrive at\\nRs.25,47,552/- (Rs.30,328 X 12 X 7). After retirement of the deceased, the\\nTribunal had divided the monthly income of the deceased by half (Rs.30,328\\n/2) to arrive at Rs.15,164/- and for four years, after retirement of the deceased,\\nthe Tribunal awarded Rs.7,27,872/-. In effect, a sum of Rs.28,38,701/- was awarded by the Tribunal towards loss of earning.\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n8/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\n13. However, we find that the Tribunal ought to have considered that\\nafter retirement, the deceased presumed to have survived for another six years,\\nbut the Tribunal has adopted '4' as the multiplier after the age of retirement of the deceased. This aspect of the matter requires modification. Thus the\\ncompensation awarded by the Tribunal towards \\u201closs of earning\\u201d is modified\\nas follows: {(30328 X 12 X 7 = 2547552) + (30328/2=15164 X 12 X 6 (after\\nretirement period))= 1091808} = 3639360 + 1091808 (30% future prospects)\\n= 4731168 X 2/3 (personal expenses) = Rs.3154112/-. 14. Similarly, we find that the Tribunal has awarded Rs.50,000/- as loss\\nof consortium to the first claimant. As per the off-quoted decision of the\\nHonorable Supreme Court in Pranay Sethi's case, the 1st appellant/claimant is\\nentitled only to Rs.40,000/- and therefore, the amount of Rs.50,000/- awarded\\nby the Tribunal is hereby reduced to Rs.40,000/-. by the Tribunal is hereby reduced to Rs.40,000/-.\\n15. The Tribunal deducted 10% towards income tax liability of the\\ndeceased, which in the opinion of this Court needs no interference. The\\ndeceased was working as a Teacher in a Government School and was earning\\nRs.70,000/- per month in the year 2009. Such amount received by the deceased\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n9/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018 9/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\nattract payment of income tax. The compensation payable to the claimants is\\nbased on the income earned by the deceased. Had the deceased been alive, he\\nwould have definitely paid income tax for his earnings. In such view of the\\nmatter, the Tribunal is right in deducting amount towards payment of income\\ntax. tax.\\n16. On perusal of the award passed by the Tribunal, this Court is of the\\nview that the amount awarded under the heads (i) funeral expenses (ii)\\ntransportation expenses are fair and reasonable and therefore, no interference\\nis required in the amount awarded by the Tribunal under the aforesaid heads.\\n17. In effect, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal is modified as\\nfollows: follows:\\nSl. Description Amount Amount Award\\nNo. awarded by the awarded by confirmed or\\nTribunal this Court enhanced or\\n(Rs.) granted\\n(Rs.)\\n1 Loss of earning Rs.28,38,701/- Rs.31,54,112/- Enhanced\\n2 Loss of consortium Rs.50,000/- Rs.40,000/- Reduced\\nfor the 1st appellant\\n3 Loss of love and Rs.30,000/- Rs.80,000/- Enhanced\\naffection for 2nd and\\n3rd appellants\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n10/14 https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\n10/14\\nC.M.A.No.1662 of 2018\\nSl.

The amounts\\nawarded by the Tribunal under different heads are very meagre and prayed for\\nenhancement of compensation.\\n4/10\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A.No.1441 of 2017\\n7.The learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company had submitted his arguments. As per his arguments, the learned Tribunal had\\nproperly assessed disability by considering medical evidence and calculated\\nthe compensation and arrived at a just compensation and the same does not\\nwarrant any interference by this Court. The appeal lacks merits and the same\\nis liable to be dismissed.\\nPoint for consideration is as follows: Point for consideration is as follows:\\nWhether the appellant is entitled to enhanced compensation as\\nprayed for?\\n8.On perusal of the records pertaining to M.C.O.P.No.4147 of 2009 on\\nthe file of Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, 2nd Small Causes Court, Chennai,\\nit is found that the learned Tribunal had fixed the income of the appellant at Rs.6,500/- p.m., and calculated the compensation ignoring the medical\\nevidence available before the Tribunal through the Dr.N.Saichandran.\\nTherefore, the disability assessed by the learned Tribunal is found to be not\\nproper. The Tribunal has not considered the loss of earning capacity suffered\\nby the appellant and the reduction of salary for his alternative job due to the\\n5/10 5/10\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A.No.1441 of 2017\\ninjury sustained by him in the accident. The loss of future prospects had not\\nbeen taken note of and the award granted under various non-pecuniary heads\\nis on the lower side. Therefore, the submission of the learned counsel for the\\nappellant/claimant is accepted. In the light of the records, the submissions of the learned counsel for the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company is rejected.\\n9.On an analysis of entire evidence both oral and documentary,\\nthis Court is of the view that the Tribunal has rightly fixed the monthly\\nincome of the injured/claimant at Rs.6,500/-. However, considering the fact\\nthat the injured sustained grievous injuries and got 30% disability, while applying multiplier '14', the Tribunal though awarded a sum of\\nRs.3,27,600/-, unfortunately, has completely ignored to add future prospects.\\nTherefore, this Court feels it appropriate to add 30% towards future\\nprospects and thereby the award under the head 'loss of earning power' due to\\npermanent disability is assessed as Rs.4,25,880/- {Rs.6,500/- + Rs.1,950/- (30% of Rs.6,500/-) X 12 X 14 X 30/100}. The claimant/injured suffered\\n30% disability which would certainly require him to undergo treatment\\nthroughout his life, but the Tribunal has not awarded any amount towards\\n6/10\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A.No.1441 of 2017\\nfuture medical expenses and therefore, this Court is inclined to award a sum of Rs.25,000/- towards future medical expenses. The Tribunal awarded a sum\\nof Rs.25,000/- towards medical expenses and the same is reduced to\\nRs.10,000/-.\\n10.It is also to be noted that since the claimant/injured suffered grievous\\ninjuries under the head of pain and sufferings, the Tribunal awarded only a\\nsum of Rs.40,000/- which in the opinion of this Court, is required to be enhanced, accordingly a sum of Rs.75,000/- is awarded under the head of\\npain and sufferings.\\n11.From the award of the Tribunal, it is seen that the appellant has\\ntaken treatment as in-patient for 112 days and also continued his treatment for\\na long time as outpatient. Considering the nature of injuries and period of\\ntreatment taken by the appellant, the amounts awarded by the Tribunal towards transportation, attendant charges and loss of amenities are meagre\\nand the same are enhanced to Rs.15,000/-, Rs.30,000/- and Rs.50,000/-\\nrespectively. In respect of other heads, the Tribunal has adequately awarded\\n7/10\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A.No.1441 of 2017\\ncompensation which do not warrant any interference. In view of the above, the award amount granted by the Tribunal is enhanced to Rs.7,00,380/- from\\nRs.5,12,100/-. The modification of award amount under the various heads,\\nare as follows:\\nS.

P.W.2/Doctor certified that the appellant suffered 50%\\ndisability and issued Ex.P8/disability certificate to that effect. The Tribunal\\nwithout giving any valid reason, reduced the percentage of disability to 16% and awarded compensation only for 16% disability. The appellant has taken\\ntreatment at Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences as in-patient from\\n3/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013\\n29.10.2010 to 03.11.2010 and thereafter took treatment as outpatient.

Due to the injuries\\nsustained by him in the accident, he could continue the work as he was doing\\nearlier. But, the Tribunal has fixed only a meagre sum of Rs.4,500/- as\\nmonthly income of the appellant while awarding compensation towards\\ndisability by adopting multiplier method. The Tribunal ought to have fixed a sum of Rs.20,000/- as monthly income of the appellant and awarded more\\ncompensation towards disability. The Tribunal has not awarded any amount\\ntowards future prospects. The amounts awarded by the Tribunal under\\ndifferent heads are meagre and prayed for enhancement of compensation.\\n6.Per contra, Mr.S.Arun Kumar, learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company contended that the appellant has not produced\\n4/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013\\nany document to prove his avocation and income. In the absence of any\\nmaterial evidence with regard to avocation and income, the monthly income\\nfixed by the Tribunal at Rs.4,500/- is on the higher side and the compensation awarded by the Tribunal towards disability by adopting multiplier method is\\nexcessive.

The appellant has not made out any case for enhancement of\\ncompensation and prayed for dismissal of the appeal.\\n7.Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant as well as the learned counsel appearing for the 2nd respondent/Insurance Company and\\nperused all the materials available on record.\\n8.From the materials available on record, it is seen that in the accident,\\nthe appellant sustained comminuted fracture of both bone right leg 1/3rd\\nclosed reduction IMIL nailing right Tibia and surgery was done on\\n5/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013 5/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013\\n29.10.2010.

To prove the nature of injuries and disability\\nsustained by him in the accident, the appellant examined P.W.2/Doctor, who has assessed the disability of the appellant as 50% and marked the disability\\ncertificate as Ex.P8. P.W.2/Doctor further deposed that due to fracture of both\\nbones, the appellant can not drive the vehicle for a long time. The Tribunal\\nconsidering the evidence of P.W.2/Doctor, Ex.P8/disability certificate and\\nnature of injuries, fixed disability suffered by the appellant at 16% for the whole body and awarded compensation towards 16% disability by adopting\\nmultiplier method. The reason given by the Tribunal for fixing disability of\\nthe appellant at 16% for whole body is proper.\\n9.It is the contention of the appellant that he was the owner-cum-driver\\nof Mahindra Tourist car and was earning a sum of Rs.20,000/- per month. To\\n6/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013 6/10\\nC.M.A.No.2723 of 2013\\nprove the same, the appellant produced Ex.P3/driving license and\\nEx.P4/Insurance permit and RC Book copy. But the appellant has not\\nproduced any document to prove his income. In the absence of any material\\nevidence to prove the avocation and income, the Tribunal fixed a sum of\\nRs.4,500/- per month as notional income of the appellant. The accident is of the year 2010 and the monthly income fixed by the Tribunal is meagre.\\nConsidering the year of accident, age and nature of work done by the\\nappellant, a sum of Rs.7,500/- per month is fixed as notional income of the\\nappellant. The appellant was aged 27 years at the time of accident. The\\nTribunal applied multiplier \\u201818\\u2019. The correct multiplier is '17'. Thus, the amount awarded by the Tribunal towards disability is modified to\\nRs.2,44,800/- (Rs.7,500/- X 12 X 17 X 16/100).

On 02.11.2008, at 5.30 p.m. while Sri.Abdul Sathar was\\nriding a motorcycle, TN-38/M-5978 vehicle driven by the 2nd\\nrespondent dashed against his motorcycle and he fell down and\\nsustained serious injuries. On the next day, he succumbed to the\\ninjuries. He was a Teacher working on deputation as BRC Trainer\\nof Block Resource Centre, Chittur, earning monthly income of Rs.16,845/- per month. The appellants approached the Tribunal\\nclaiming compensation of Rs.10,50,000/-. But the Tribunal\\nawarded only Rs.6,96,500/-, which is under challenge.\\n3. The 3rd respondent in this appeal is the Insurer of the\\noffending vehicle. The accident, death of Sri.Abdul Sathar and\\nthe insurance policy of the offending vehicle are not in dispute. MACA 2137 of 2013 4 4. Now let us see whether any interference is warranted in\\nthe impugned award.\\n5. Admittedly, the deceased Abdul Sathar was a School\\nTeacher working on deputation as BRC Trainer in Block Resource\\nCentre and he was drawing monthly income of Rs.16,845/-.\\nExt.A19 his last Pay Certificate was proved through PW1. So\\nthere is no dispute regarding his monthly income. He was 54 years old at the time of death as his date of birth was\\n22.07.1954. The Tribunal applied split multiplier as there was\\nonly one year and 5 months for him to retire from service. So for\\nthat period, his monthly income was taken as Rs.16,845/- and\\nfor the remaining 9 years and 7 months, a notional income of\\nRs.4,500/- was fixed. The Apex Court in various decisions deprecated the practice of applying split multiplier. In Valli vs.\\nTamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd. reported in\\n[2022 (1) KLT OnLine 1190 (SC)] the Apex Court affirmed the\\nneed of applying the multiplier as laid down in various decisions\\nincluding Sarala Varma vs. Delhi Transport Corporation\\n[2010 (2) KLT 802 (SC) and National Insurance Company MACA 2137 of 2013 5 Ltd. v. Pranay Sethi and Others, [2017 (4) KLT 662 (SC)]. So\\nthe Tribunal went wrong in applying split multiplier while\\ncomputing dependency compensation.\\n6. Admittedly, his monthly income was Rs.16,845/-. Since\\nhe was aged only 54, going by Pranay Sethi's case cited\\n(Supra), he was entitled for 15% addition towards future\\nprospects. So his income could be assessed as Rs.19,372/- per month. So, his annual income would have been Rs.2,32,464/-.\\nWhen 10% is deducted towards Income Tax, it would become\\nRs.2,09,218/-. Since he was having five dependents \\u00bc has to be\\ndeducted towards his personal expenses. So the balance income\\nwould have been Rs.1,56,914/- per annum. Applying the\\nmultiplier of 11, the compensation for loss of dependency would have been assessed as Rs.17,26,023/-. On deducting\\nRs.6,61,350/- awarded by the Tribunal towards loss of\\ndependency, the balance towards enhanced compensation for\\nloss of dependency would be Rs.10,64,673/-.\\n7. The Tribunal awarded only Rs.3,000/- towards funeral\\nexpenses. The appellants are entitled to get Rs.15,000/-. So, as MACA 2137 of 2013 6 enhanced compensation for funeral expenses, they will get\\nRs.12,000/-.\\n8. Towards loss of estate Rs.5,000/- only was awarded by\\nthe Tribunal, instead of Rs.15,000/-. So under that head, the\\nappellants will get Rs.10,000/- more as enhanced compensation.\\nTowards loss of consortium and loss of love and affection, the\\nTribunal awarded Rs.25,000/- in total. As the appellants are the wife, children and mother of the deceased, they are eligible to\\nget compensation for loss of consortium spousal, filial and\\nparental. Going by Pranay Sethi's case cited (Supra), they will\\nget Rs.44,000/- each including 10% hike for the delay in three\\nyears. So, they are eligible to get total amount of Rs.2,20,000/-\\nunder the head 'loss of consortium'. After deducting Rs.25,000/- already awarded, they will get Rs.1,95,000/- as enhanced\\ncompensation towards loss of consortium.\\nHead of claim Amount Amount Difference to be awarded by awarded in drawn as the\\nTribunal appeal enhanced compensation\\nLoss of Rs.6,61,350/- Rs.17,26,023/- Rs.10,64,673 /- MACA 2137 of 2013 7\\ndependency\\nFuneral Rs.3,000/- Rs.15,000/- Rs.12,000/- expenses Loss of estate Rs.5,000/- Rs.15,000/- Rs.10,000/-\\nLoss of Rs.25,000/- Rs.2,20,000/- Rs.1,95,000/- consortium & loss of love and affection\\nTotal Rs.12,81,673/-\\nEnhanced compensation is Rs.12,81,673/-\\n9.

Taking into consideration the evidence avilable on record, the\\nTribunal has held that the accident has taken place only due to the rash\\nand negligent driving of the driver of the offending vehicle, which was\\ninsured with the appellant herein and based upon the medical evidence, the Tribunal held that the deceased died due to the injuries sustained in\\nthe accident and awarded a sum of Rs.14,50,000/- (Rupees Fourteen\\nLakhs and Fifty Thousand only) together with interest at the rate of 9%\\nper annum to the respondents 1 to 3/claimants. Aggrieved over the\\nquantum of compensation awarded by the Tribunal, the United India Insurance Company has filed the present appeal under Section 173 of the\\nMotor Vehicles Act, 1988.\\n5. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the medical\\nevidence dose not support the contention of the claim petitioners that the\\ninjured deceased died only due to the accidental injuries and further\\n3/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019 C.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\ncontended that the rate of interest is 7.5% per annum only and decides\\nconventional heads and therefore, are not in accordance with law as per\\nthe decision laid down in National Insurance Co. vs Pranay sethi and\\nothers reported in 2017 (2) TNMAC 601.\\n6. The learned counsel for the respondent would contend that at the time of the accident, the deceased was aged about 44 years and she\\nwas working as a Staff Nurse and hence, the fixation of the notional\\nincome of the deceased is erroneous and prayed that even before there\\nbeing any cross objection or cross appeal for enhancement of\\ncompensation by the claimants, the Court can suo motu enhance the\\ncompensation subject to the payment of Court fee. compensation subject to the payment of Court fee.\\n7. Heard both sides and perused the materials avilable on record.\\n8. The manner of the accident is described as under :-\\nOn 10.02.2015, at about 04.00 pm., the deceased was riding a TVS\\nScooty Pep bearing Registration No.TN-05-W-3002 on the Tirunelveli-\\nTiruchendur main road, near Kumarapuram Maveeran Nagar Vilakku\\n4/14 4/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\ntowards west on the left side of the road and at that time, a TVS Apache\\nbearing Registration No.TN-22-BK-3135 belonging to the first\\nrespondent insured with the second respondent came from just behind the\\ndeeased motorcycle in a high speed and hit against the rear portion of the motorcycle of the deceased, as a result of which, the deceased was\\nthrown out of the motorcylce and fell down on the road and sustained\\nserious head injuries besides multiple injuries all over the body.\\n9. It is the specific evidence of P.W.1 that while the deceased,\\nnamely, Dhanalakshmi was riding her two wheeler bearing Registration No.TN-05-W-3002, a vehicle insured with the appellant/Insurance\\nCompany came from the just behind the motorcycle of the deceased in a\\nhigh speed and while overtaking, dashed against the on-going two\\nwheeler of the deceased and thereby, caused the accident. The oral\\nevidence of P.W.1 is duly collaborated with Ex.P1/FIR.\\n10. On the side of appellant/Insurance Company, no one was examined and the rider of the two wheeler/offending vehicle, which was\\ninsured with the appellant/Insurance company has also not been\\n5/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\nexamined. Hence, I find that in view of clear and cogent evidence of P.W.\\n1 and Ex.P1 and in the absence of any positive suggestions from the cross-examination of P.W.1 and in the absence of any contrary evidence\\nbeing adduced by the Insurance Company, the finding rendered by the\\nTribunal that the accident had taken place only due to the rash and\\nnegligent driving of the offending vehicle, which was insured with the\\nappellant/insurance company is well considered and well merited and therefore, it does not warrant any interference and hence, the same is\\nhereby confirmed.\\n11. The another contention of the appellant is that the deceased has\\nnot died due to the accidental injuries. The lower Court records would\\nreveal that Dr.Arunagiri and Dr.Ramanathapandian were examined by the\\nclaim petitioner as P.W.2 and P.W.3 and the Accident Register marked as Ex.P3, discharge summary of Shipa Nurshing Home and Mahalakshmi\\nNurshing Home for the period from 10.02.2015 to 20.02.2015 and RSP\\nhospital discharge summary for the period from 04.03.2015 to\\n07.03.2015, would clearly show that in the accident, deceased\\nDhanalakshmi has sustained bleedings in the brain and also blood clot\\n6/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019 C.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\nfor which, Eptoin tablet was given and thereafter, the same was stopped.\\nAn attempt was made in the cross-examination that the said tablets were\\ngiven for 'fits' is also negatived by the competent witnesses, namely P.W.\\n2 and PW.3. From Exs.P6 and P7.\\n12. I find that the deceased suffered grievous injuries, which are acute Subarachnoid I lemorrhage in bilateral parietal convexity. Multiple\\nfoci of intraparenchymal hemorrhagic contusion in left tempora and\\nparietal lobe with surrounding edema. Thin MM Resolving subdural\\nhemorrhage in left fronto paricetal convexity. No evidence of midline\\nshift/brain herniation. Linear non-displaced fracture of right parictal bone with horizontal fracture of right mastoid with hemomastoid. Thin linear\\nnon-displaced fracture of floor of sphenoid sinus. Displaced spiral\\nfracture in right clavicle at junction of middle 1/3 and lateral 1/3.\\nCalcified granuluma in right upper lobe and right middle lobe. Left\\nminimal pleural effusion. Right moderate pleural effusion. Musaic attenuation due to air trapping inbilateral lung Parenchyama.\\n7/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\n13. Ex.P16 discharge summary it is specifically held that the\\ndeceased Dhanalakshmi has suffered serious brin injuries. The said\\ndischarge summary was clearly colaborated with the oral evidence of\\nP.W.2/Dr.Arunagiri, who is from Sheepa Nurshing Home and from the medical evidence of P.W.2 and P.W.3/Doctors, I find that necessary\\ntablets were given for the blood clot in the Brain. Furthermore, from the\\nabove said documents, it is seen that the deceased Dhanalakshmi had\\ntaken treament from the date of accident, namely, 10.02.2015 and\\n17.04.2015. The above said injury is duly reflected in the\\nEx.P4/discharge summary and the nature of the injury has been duly reflected. Furthermore, it remains to be stated that the Insurance\\nCompany has not let in any contra evidence to disbelieve the medical\\nevidence of P.W.2 and P.W.3 and also Exs.P3, P4, P5, P6, P7, P15, P16\\nand P17.\\n14. In the decisions reported in 2014 (1) TNMAC 384 and 2015\\n(1) TNMAC 526, this Court has held that when the injury on account of the accident and the factum of the accident are admitted and continous\\ntreatment till the death is proved, it can safely inferred that the death was\\n8/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\non the account of the injuries sustained in the accident and hence, I find\\nthat the claimants let in positive evidence to show and demonstrate that in the accident taken place on 10.02.2015, Dhanalakshmi had suffered\\nabove said injury and was taking treatment and subsequently, while\\ncontintuity of the treatment she died and hence, I have no hesitation to\\nhold that she died due to the accidental injuries and hence, the above\\ncontention of the appellant stands negatived and the finding of the Tribunal that on the scope as stated supra is hereby upheld and the owner\\nof the two wheeler and the Insurance Company/appellat herein are jointly\\nand severally liable to pay the compensation.\\n15. On the point of quantum, both the parties are heard. The claim\\npetitioners stated that the deceased was working as staff nurse after her post graduate and no positive evidence was produced before the Tribunal\\nto prove her work. Taking note of the evidence of P.W.1 and the fact that\\nthe accident is of the year 2015, the Tribunal fixed the monthly income of\\nthe deceased as Rs.6,000/- (Rupees Six thousand only). Since three\\npersons are depending on the income of the deceased, 1/3rd is deducted towards the personal expenses of the deceased. Based upon the\\n9/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\ndocuments, the Tribunal has taken the age of the deceased as '44' and\\nproper multiplier that has to be adopted in the instant case is 14 as per the\\ndecision rendered in Sarla Varma and others vs. Delhi Transport\\nCorporation and another reported in (2009) 6 SCC 121. As per the decision laid down in National Insurance Co. vs Pranay sethi and\\nothers reported in 2017 (2) TNMAC 601, the Tribunal added 30%\\ntowards future prospectus of the deceased and hence, peculiar loss\\nsustained by the claimants/petitioners, calculated by the Tribunal is\\nhereby found to be just and fair. For the loss of felisial consortium, the husband is entitled for Rs.40,000/- and the claimants 2 and 3 being the\\ndaughters are entitled for Rs.80,000/- (Rs.40,000 + Rs.40,000/-). The\\nTribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.20,000/-, Rs.25,000/- and Rs.20,000/-\\nrespectively towards transportation, funeral expenses and attender\\ncharges and extra nourishment, which are very excessive and the same is reduced to Rs.15,000/- respectively. The Tribunal has rightly awarded a\\nsum of Rs.12,000/- towards loss of income during the treatment period of\\ntwo months and a sum of Rs.1,35,890/- towards medical bills as per\\nEx.P14. The Tribunal has not awarded any compensation towards loss of\\nestate and this Court is inclined to award a sum of Rs.15,000/- towards\\n10/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis 10/14\\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\\nC.M.A(MD)No.151 of 2019\\nloss of estate. Rate of interest 9% per annum awarded by the Tribunal is\\nreduced to 7.5% per annum.\\n16.
